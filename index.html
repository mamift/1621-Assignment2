				<h1>Welcome!</h1>
			
				<p>
					Lockhart &amp; Gardner, formerly Stern, Lockhart &amp; Gardner is a Chicago-based law firm that makes a genuine difference to people's lives. We fight for the downtrodden and those wronged as we believe the world generally is a mean place. We think our clients deserve someone not only to stand up for them, but to fight for them and their rights.
				</p>

				<p>
					If you are someone who is being harassed by police, the government, getting screwed over by your former partner or some other guy, you need a person to stand up and fight for you. That's where we come in. 
				</p>

				<h2>Our Services</h2>
				<p>
					We are amongst the top criminal defence lawyers in Chicago. As accomplished court advocates and experts in our field, we are confident that there is no matter too small or too large for us to deal with (even gigantic class-action lawsuits). Our experience in criminal law ranges from minor driving offences to serious criminal offences including murder, manslaughter, complex fraud, and serious drug matters. We are also experts in all types of traffic matters, including licence appeals, police suspensions and challenging traffic infringement notices.
				</p>
					
				<a name="toc3"></a>
				<h2>Our Promise</h2>
				<p>
					Unlike other law firms, at Lockhart &amp; Gardner Lawyers we stand behind our clients with whatever charge they are facing. We’ll fight hard to protect your rights and build a strong case for your defence - and if you retain us and we don't win for you in court, then you won't have to pay us a cent - that's our promise.
