				<h1>About Us</h1>
				<h2>History</h2>
				<p>Lockhart &amp; Gardner was once known as 'Stern, Lockart &amp; Gardner'.</p>

				<p>The firm was founded by Jonas Stern approximately a few years ago. Soon, he hired another partner, Diane Lockhart. Next, he hired Will Gardner, the most junior of the named partners. Stern took leave for a year, leaving Diane and Will in charge of the firm. In his absence, Will and Diane hired twenty or so associates, including one of Will's old University friends Alicia Florrick.</p>

				<p>Stern returned to the firm when he was being accused of DUI (driving under the influence) and battery against a police officer. After being cleared, Stern quit the firm to start his own law firm, taking his clients and a substantial amount of business away from the firm.</p>

				<p>This and the recession in 2008 left the firm in a precarious financial position, and Diane, the one who manages the firm's finance, struggles to keep the firm afloat. The remaining partners later merged with Derrick Bond's firm, Bond &amp; Associates, and the company was renamed Lockhart/Gardner &amp; Bond. </p>

				<p>When Bond attempted to manipulate Will and Dianne and remove Diane Lockhart as a partner, Will and Diane discovered this and later were able to force him out. </p>
